Use OCR to Search Warhammer Paint Shelf at Local Game Shop

## The Problem
There's a shelf of paints at a game store near me. It takes too long to find
a paint by name. I'm going to ~~attempt to use OCR to~~ get the locations of
the paints in an image, and then use that data to create a simple webapp that
can help me locate a color on the rack.

## To Do
* Create Big Image - Put the source images into one large image, with one
layer being the photo of the entire rack, and another layer being the separate
images with higher resolution.
* Generate Name-Location Data - OCR wasn't working, and there's only 360 slots
of paint. I can still make a tool to speed up manual entry.
* Web App - Create simple web page to search for the location of a paint.
